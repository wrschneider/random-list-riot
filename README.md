This is a sample project to teach myself the basics of riot.js, like 
managing lists.

You MUST run this on a server.  A file:// URL will probably make your browser complain about cross-origin requests because of the way that the Riot tag compiler works.  Simplest way to do this is through node's http-server.

You put in a list of people's names and the button randomly picks one.
